# SwiftChess

SwiftChess is a chess engine written in Swift.

Rather than a library that you can call to assist in making valid chess moves, SwiftChess aims to be a complete chess game, minus the UI.

SwiftChess also includes a complete AI implementation.

There's no documentation for now, as the public api is still in flux, but there is a complete example project for iOS.

SwiftChess also has a reasonably comprehensive set of unit tests.

## Example

Run `Example/Example.xcodeproj`

The example app can run *player vs player*, *player vs AI*, *AI vs AI* matches
